                                            <p class="card-text">The Grid View module is very useful in monitoring the status of electrical networks and assets within the operational boundaries of distribution and transmission companies. From this module you can get the status of the power supply in an electrical network within a geographical area. You can optimise the use of electrical assets and improve its life cycle. This is achieved by using our unique set of algorithms built in our solution.</p>

                                           
                                            <p>The electrical network can be viewed at various voltage levels, transformers levels, feeder level etc. </p>
                                          
                                            <p>When you select a transformer or feeder on the grid view system, you can monitor the electrical parameters of that asset and the details of the customers to whom the power is supplied to. Because our solution is modular and integrated, the power supply information is also available in the customer information system, call centre and other modules etc. </p>

                                     

                                            <p>The operator can make changes in power supply depending on the site conditions by using the switch-off and switch-on features of the grid view system. Site operations such as change in power supply, replacement of transformers or changes in location of power supply can be made through this system. The system automatically triggers an SMS message or an email to affected customers about power outages. This helps distribution companies in improving customer satisfaction via a mobile application.</p>
                                            
                                            
                                            <p>The electrical grid line supply status is indicated with different colours.  For example, a red colour indicates the power supply line is under maintenance and a green indicates live condition. The operator can monitor electrical parameters and check the existing load on a transformer by clicking on the transformer in the grid view module.</p>
